# Publishing a game (the runbook)

Ratchet status: pass 1 (one command + narrative + Mike's go). Each pass
removes a named manual step; see the plan and spec section 6.

## Game night + day after

1. Export the PokerNow log CSV. It is PRIVATE; it never enters this repo.
2. Write `results.json` (the judged part): `[{handle, finish, payout, rebuys, trophies}]`.
3. Run: `bun tools/publish-game.ts <log.csv> --date YYYY-MM-DD --results results.json`
   - Halts on chip-conservation mismatch or an unknown handle. Fix the input,
     never the check.
4. Write the narrative page `site/games/<date>/index.html` (copy an existing
   game page shell). Dignity rule; no em dashes; no collections/owed content.
   The shell includes the head chrome (favicon link, meta description from
   the stat line), the lens pills under the h1 (Story · Results · Chip race
   · Standings, plus "The cards" once the month's set page exists), the
   `stat stat-strip` fact line, `id="story"`/`id="results"` anchors, and
   `ledger ledger--notes` on the results table. Copy the newest game page
   to get all of it.
5. Update `nextGame` in `site/data/games.json`.
6. Review the full diff. Get Mike's explicit go. Push. Cloudflare deploys.
7. Board: comment results on the month's game issue, close it, open next
   month's issue, add to project #1.

## Cards (per set, still manual by design)

Card copy is judgment; it does not automate. Render per
`munger/ccg/launch-aug-2026/ASSETS.md`, add `site/cards/<YYYY-MM>/`.

## Reminder export (emails, Tier 2)

`wrangler d1 execute poker-rsvp-db --command "SELECT email FROM rsvps WHERE game='YYYY-MM-DD'"`
prints to stdout. Never redirect into a file inside this repo.
